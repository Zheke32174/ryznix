# Ryznix

A rootless, multi-libc, multi-architecture Linux subsystem that runs entirely from
`/data/local/tmp` on an **unrooted Android phone** — governed by a microkernel written
in **ryz** (our own language, compiled to native ELF via `ryznative`).

No root. No proot. No bootloader unlock. Just the `shell` user (uid 2000) via Shizuku/rish.

## Start here

- **Portfolio overview:** [SHOWCASE.md](SHOWCASE.md)
- **Proof-log guide:** [docs/proof/README.md](docs/proof/README.md)
- **Secret/redaction checklist:** [docs/publication-checklist.md](docs/publication-checklist.md)

This repo is a public-facing showcase for the Ryznix side of the broader RYZ ecosystem. Some supporting projects and raw device logs remain private because they may contain host paths, tokens, tunnel details, device identifiers, or operator-only workflow notes.

## What it is

```
 Android kernel (aarch64) ── SELinux/syscall boundary
   ▲ shell uid 2000 (Shizuku / rish)
 RYZNIX tmp-kernel  (ryz → ryznative native ELFs)
   • ryzkern    — execution authority: classifies by ELF e_machine + stratum,
                  routes each binary to the correct runtime, pristine (no patchelf)
   • pm-server  — MINIX-style Process Manager   (running, supervised)
   • ds-server  — MINIX-style Data Store         (running, persistent)
   • RS         — reincarnation/supervision (auto-restart)
   • IPC (SENDREC over FIFOs) · klog · nss identity · strata.conf
        routes to:
   ┌ x86_64 (QEMU) ┬ aarch64/musl ┬ aarch64/glibc (Ubuntu) ┬ aarch64/bionic (Termux) ┐
   └ elevator: make-everything-native (source→native, foreign→native, RE→rewrite→native) ┘
```

**Four ABIs under one kernel** — x86_64 (emulated), plus three native libcs — on one phone.

## Layout

- `ryz/`      — the microkernel + servers + trampolines + launcher, in ryz
- `bin/`      — Termux launchers (`ryznix`, `ryznix-status`, `rk`), the ELF classifier, the `elevator` native pipeline
- `scripts/`  — the build/deploy pipeline (lib staging via the `/sdcard` SELinux bridge, Ubuntu rootfs, the self-healing installer, the corruption sweep)
- `examples/` — C demos for the elevate-to-native loop
- `SUPERLINUX-HOWTO.md` — the deep technical writeup (every wall and workaround)

## Key techniques

- **/sdcard tar bridge** to cross the SELinux `untrusted_app` ↔ `shell` barrier
- **PIE vs non-PIE** corruption rule (patchelf corrupts ET_EXEC → trampoline instead)
- **ryz native trampolines** resolve own path via `/proc/$PPID/exe`, exec the glibc loader (shebang-capable, unlike shell wrappers)
- glibc wrappers via loader `--preload` (not inherited env) so bionic children stay clean
- stratum-path + `e_machine` routing; QEMU user-mode for foreign arches
- the **elevator**: rebuild emulated/foreign binaries as native; RE → rewrite → native

> Research / hobby project. Built across one (very long) session.

## Conquests (the full realm)

| Territory | Status |
|---|---|
| bionic (Termux) | ✅ native |
| glibc (Ubuntu, ~290 pkgs) | ✅ ELF-converted / kernel-routed |
| musl (Alpine) | ✅ via loader |
| **x86_64** (foreign CPU) | ✅ via QEMU user-mode |
| ryz/MINIX microkernel | ✅ PM/DS/RS servers running, supervised, IPC |
| elevator (make-everything-native) | ✅ source→native, foreign→native, RE→rewrite→native |
| RE arsenal | ✅ Ghidra 12 (analyzes), radare2, nasm, binutils-multiarch |
| **Nix (rootless, builds derivations)** | ✅ loader-trick + relocated store + native builder — *no root/proot/userns* |
| Tailscale (rootless) | ✅ shell-uid + abstract socket (SELinux workaround) |
| Nix (full nixpkgs build) | ⚠️ frontier: elevator-as-builder unification |

Every wall met was either gone *around* (microkernel, abstract sockets, loader tricks)
or built *through* (Nix). The only true physics limits: locked bootloader (no uid 0),
blocked user-namespaces, foreign-ABI without emulation.

Launchers (Termux home): `~/ryznix` `~/ryznix-status` `~/rk` `~/nixrun` `~/tailscale`
